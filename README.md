A simple website implementation in Node.JS

This is very basic website I made to practice server implementation and routing in Node.JS!

simplestServer.ts is commented out by default, but that is the first server I ever wrote!

The default, index.ts, is slightly more complicated and will return html files (or a 404 file) by request
